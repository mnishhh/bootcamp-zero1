OLX-

1.Number verification- these feature would be great as the people sell their vehicles, so before posting any ads about vehicles
olx should include feature which take only legal vehicles on their site.

2.Delivery option from olx itself-these feature should be include as option because for most of people  its not possible to go for long distance and check product so by doing 
delivery from olx it would be great and along with that return could also be there.

3.Bill upload -it would be great mostly for electronics items.if olx could do some changes and add these option.most of the sellers post their ads just by giving fake claim about product quality 
and warranty in description and when buyer gets to know about it then it would be time waste on such disscussion.

4.government id verification- for the purpose of security these feature is must because now a days thousands of peoples upload fake product and try to convince buyers  to meet them so it could be insecurity
point of view .
